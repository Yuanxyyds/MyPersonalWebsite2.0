# MyPersonalWebsite2.0

My personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and experience in AI, software development, and full-stack engineering. This was the second version of my personal website, which is developed using **React JS** with a self-hosted **Django backend**. 

The updated version includes a redesigned architecture, new UI features, a Next.js-based deployment workflow, and integrated AI services such as StevenAI.
